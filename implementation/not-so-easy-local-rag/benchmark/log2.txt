Question: How can we resolve this alarm? SYSTEM MAJOR ALARMS (GENERIC) - CHECK DIAGNOSTIC
Response: # Resolving System Major Alarms with Diagnostic Check ## References: - FAQ:How can we resolve this alarm? SYSTEM MAJOR ALARMS (GENERIC) - CHECK DIAGNOSTIC - 6.1 Troubleshooting  To resolve the SYSTEM MAJOR ALARS (GENERIC) - check diagnostic, try checking the diagnostics on the HMI panel. If the problem persists, power cycling the machine may be necessary. If the issue continues after that, it's recommended to contact Boatopack for further assistance at service@boatpack.com.  If you've already checked the HMI panel and still can't resolve the issue, some of the alarm types that have a similar cause and solution are found in the table 6 TROUBLESHOOTING FOREWORD. For example, ALARM TYPE A162/163 or A135/136, which could be related to a "circuit breaker or inverter is in alarm status." You can try checking the circuit breaker and inverting components for any potential issues.  However, since your error specifically mentions SYSTEM MAJOR ALARS (GENERIC), it would be best to refer directly to the troubleshooting chapter 6.1 Troubleshooting, where the generic causes and solutions are more directly applicable to generic system alarms.

Question: Why machine is not moving in manual mode?
Response: # Machine Not Moving in Manual Mode ## References: - 5.3.23 Belt 2 (optional) - FAQ:Why machine is not moving in manual mode?  If the machine does not move in manual mode, check:  - Presence of electrical power and air pressure in the circuit. - HMI screen for alarms, particularly "Overspeed alarms". If present, check that the overspeed sensors related to the axis indicated in the alarm are intact and working, and that the distance between the proximity and the cam is no more than 0.3mm. As specified in Section 5.3.23 Belt 2 (optional), the "BELT MODE AUTO" button allows the operator to start manually the belt, even with the machine stopped. Verify that this button is functioning correctly.  Additionally, as stated in the FAQ:Why machine is not moving in manual mode?, if there are no alarms, check all the overspeed proximity switches in the same way as mentioned above.

Question: Why machine is not moving after switch on?
Response: # Troubleshooting Steps for Non-Movement After Switch On ## References: - 1. Why machine is not moving after switch on? - 2. Why machine is not moving in manual mode?  First, please check if the homing procedure is being performed when the emergency is reset. If so, refer to the wiring diagram to inspect the Start button circuit. Otherwise, verify that electrical power and air are present. If these checks pass, investigate the safety circuit. Since you've reached this step, it's possible there's an issue with the machine's EtherCAT network. Look for a specific alarm on the HMI panel or one on the PLC; if you find any, contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com) for assistance.

Question: Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?
Response: ## Machine Not Moving After Switching from Manual Mode to Automatic Mode ### References: - FAQ:Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?  Try resetting any alarms. Also, try forcing a homing procedure (press start and immediately press the emergency button; then reset the alarms, reset the emergency).   Note: This solution has been retrieved from the chapter "FAQ:Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?" which suggests that it might be related to an issue with alarm resetting or a homing procedure. However, without further information on these processes and their settings, precise troubleshooting may be difficult. It is thus essential to consult the machine's user manual or contact Boatopack for support if issues persist after attempting these steps.

Question: Doser is enabled and in line, but it does not move, why?
Response: # Possible Causes for Doser Not Moving ## References: - FAQ:Doser is enabled and in line, but it does not move, why?    The doser may not be moving because of possible causes such as a faulty movement transmission mechanics, an incorrectly calibrated film joint system, or a timing issue with the homing procedure. Additionally, there could be mechanical problems within the doser drive and motor.  To resolve this issue, you can try performing a homing procedure to see if it fixes the problem. If that doesn't work, check the movement transmission mechanics according to the doser manual. Also, verify that the film joint system is enabled and calibrated correctly, and make sure the Doser Online sensor is functioning properly.  If the doser has timed out during automatic movement, check the time settings for the homing procedure in the machine's software or settings.
