- Verify that the safety circuit is functioning correctly.

If none of these checks resolve the issue, a problem with your machine's EtherCAT network may be the cause. In this case, investigate for specific alarms on either the HMI panel or PLC. If you're unable to identify the source of the malfunction after completing the above checks, please contact us at service@boatopack.com.

## Additional Tips:
- Before changing any parameters on the panel, ensure that your communication between HMI and PLC functions properly.
- Incorrect connections for line phases may trigger error messages like A114.
- Overload issues, reflected in alarms such as A152/153 or A133, indicate problems related to excessive drawing of power by connected devices, usually indicating mechanical issues.
Question: Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?

- FAQ:Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?

Try resetting any alarms and forcing a homing procedure (press start and immediately press the emergency button; then reset the alarms, reset the emergency).

Also, check if the machine performs the homing procedure when the emergency is reset. If so, refer to Chapter 5.3.23 for further assistance.

Additionally, ensure that all settings, especially those related to belt modes (Chapter 5.3.23 and 5.3.24), are correctly configured and enabled as they might impact the automatic mode's functionality.
Question: Doser is enabled and in line, but it does not move, why?

- A179 - DOSER OUT OF LINE
- FAQ: How can we resolve this alarm? ALARM DOSER MOVEMENT TIMEOUT

The doser might not be moving because it's possible that the homing procedure wasn't done correctly. Try resetting any alarms and then forcing a homing procedure by pressing the start button and immediately pressing the emergency button, then reset the alarms and emergency.

However, if the doser drive or motor is malfunctioning, the issue may still persist. It's also recommended to check the mechanical transmissions and homing proximity sensor for any potential issues.

If none of these steps resolve the problem, you might need to investigate further by checking the movement transmission mechanics (refer to the doser manual) or the integrity, position, and operation of the Doser Online sensor (refer to the wiring diagram).

First, find out where the sachets are leaking (vertical or transverse seal). Check if the sachets made without product have air leaks. If so, refer to the maintenance chapter of the manual for guidance on checking the cleanliness, integrity, and operation of the sealing stations.

If there is no air leak, then check the correct dosing phase, referring to the doser manual, as incorrect dosing may cause leaking products.

If the problem is still not solved, contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com) for further assistance.

* FAQ: The reel unwinder does not move properly, we often have alarms related to it, what can I do?

First, check that the film passage in the internal part of the machine is correct. If present, it may be that the rotary sensor of the reel unwinder is not calibrated. Refer to the rotary sensor calibration procedure for further instructions.

If the issue persists, you may want to refer to error codes A167 and A168, which seem related to the unwinder's speed and movement.
Question: When i change some parameter on the panel the machine doesn't react. what can be the problem?
Response: # Communication Issues Between HMI and PLC
## References:
- 5.3 Panel PC
- FAQ:When i change some parameter on the panel the machine doesn't react. what can be the problem?

The issue may likely be due to a problem with communication between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This is indicated in the relevant FAQs which suggest checking if the ethernet cable connecting the two devices is intact, correctly connected, and if this resolves the issue.
