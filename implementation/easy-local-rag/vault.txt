2 INTRODUCTION       PREAMBLE          This section describes the features of the machine TORNADO Evolution, describing its potential, the hardware and its functional part.	   
2.1 Tornado EVOlution  
2.1.1 General information The TORNADO-EVOlution is a vertical packaging machine designed to form, fill and seal on 4 sides sachets of thermo sealable material [Fig. 1].  Fig. 1 - Sachets of thermo sealable.  The TORNADO-EVOlution has been developed with the idea to improve the already well consolidated and successful features of the existing Tornado machine. Thanks to the extensive utilization of servomotor technology, the last limitations have been removed. The core of the TORNADO-EVOlution is a MOTION CONTROLLER with integrated PLC functions. This multitasking CPU can manage simultaneously up to 32 axes. The controller communicates with servo drives and remote I/O through ETHERCAT bus and exchanges data with other devices (operator panel, remote access device, etc.) through Ethernet network. Constructed with a modular system to facilitate rapid size change operations. The reel of packaging material is housed inside the machine, completely enclosed and protected from external contamination; the reel shaft is positioned to permit easy mounting. Basic operations are controlled by motion controller interfaced with a display panel. Touchscreen operator panel (12.1) [Fig. 2] permit the visualization of the following operations from the control panel: length of sachet, output speed, temperature of sealing jaws and sealing rollers, bag counter, machine alarms, etc. Settings that can be made from the control panel include: length of sachet, output speed, number of sachets to form a group, sealing temperatures, timing for various devices such as printer, vibrator, etc. Photocell mark registration for printed film.  Fig. 2 - Operator panel. 
2.1.2 Applications The packaging machine you have purchased is among the most recent, innovative and efficient manufactured by the company. A device always most developed that is able to adapt to various customer needs thanks to its strength in the quality of the materials selected and the requirements of new technologies applied. Is used for products of different composure, for the most compact and consistent liquid state or the most fluid and liquefied, but also for the solid state in tablets, granules or powders. Each product has its needs, which leads to changes into the mechanical and into the technology design of engineers Boato Pack, using different types of dispensers, and another types of operations. The dimensions of the machine may vary according to the size of the bags in relation to the amount that is necessary by produce. In addition, the machine can also be flanked by lines of packing and packaging, which are designed and adapted by the company, always offering a car tailor-made for each client. 2.1.3  The sachets The sachet that is realized by the machine may have weight and dimensions according to the type of product and the various needs of the customer [Fig. 3]. The sachet is made from a thermo sealable material which is sealed on all 4 sides of the finished product through a system patented by Boato Pack to ensure the best sealing without leakage. The sealing of the sachet may, however, depend on the quality and the number of layers of the packing material.  Fig. 3 - Four side sealed sachets.  IMPORTANT!! To ensure optimum sealing of the sealing made by the machine must ensure optimum cleaning of welded areas.  
2.1.4 Functional description The sachets are formed by the reel of packaging material that is cut, centered and unified from both sides. The product after being loaded on the container in the shape of inverted pyramidal cone, called hopper, is inserted into the bag almost format, just before the pouch is sealed on the top. The bags that are formed in the strip are then cut or stripped according to need and is made out of the machine.      3

4.1.1 First section idle rollers It is made up of two rollers located at the sealing group sides. They receive the packaging material from the paper divider and they send it towards the rubbered rollers. 
4.1.2 Path adjustment rollers  Fig. 16 - Path adjustment rollers. They permit to independently adjust the path of front and rear side of the wrapping material in order to match the front and rear printing of every single sachet. 
4.1.3 Mark and joint photocells Near the path adjustment rollers on the two sides of the film path there are two photocells used to detect the mark and the joint of the film. - The mark photocell [Fig. 17.1] is placed on the left side of the machine in the internal part of the film path and detects the marks [Fig. 17.2] on the film in order to continuously adjust the phase of the machine to ensure a correct filling, sealing and cutting of the sachets respect to the film drawing.  Fig. 17 - Mark photocell. - The joint photocell [Fig. 18] is placed on the right side of the machine in the external part of the film path and it is used to detect the joint of the material in order to discharge the part of the film with the joint.  Fig. 18 - Joint photocell. ADJUSTMENT The photocells need to properly configure in order to work correctly. The settings of their switching threshold is very easy and must be performed as follow: - Turn the switch in the teach position[Fig. 19.1]; - Put the mark or the joint under the laser beam and press the TEACH button until the Q led flashes[Fig. 19.2]; - Put the laser beam out of the mark or joint and press the TEACH button until the Q led flashes[Fig. 19.3]; - Turn the switch in the run position [Fig. 19.4].   Fig. 19 - Photocells tech-in procedure. After the Teach-in settings the led Q must light up when the mark or the joint passes under the laser beam. 
4.1.4 Rubbered rollers  Fig. 20 - Rubbered rollers, screw. They are located in the upper part of the sealing station, at the very end of it. They are covered by a special anti-slip rubber, whose function is that of driving the packaging material towards the sealing rollers. Each roller axle is held by means of the screw [Fig. 20], by loosening which you can free the roller: the driving of the packaging material will be effected by means of the sealing rollers. 
4.1.5 Second section idle rollers  Fig. 21 - Second section idle rollers. They are located at the upper end of the sealing group, in a position that allows a regular unwinding of the packaging material towards the sealing rollers. 
4.1.6 Rotating knives  Fig. 22 - Hardened rollers and dividing knives. They are located between the rubbered rollers and the second section of idle rollers. The rotating knives [Fig. 22] press on the hardened rollers so as to divide the film in lanes and they are controlled pneumatically by a cylinder. These rollers are made of a very resistant material which guarantees a low grade of wear and tear to the knives and therefore a good counter cut. 
4.1.7 Sealing rollers The sealing rollers allow the longitudinal sachet sealing. Their peripheral speed is equal to the rubbered rollers speed. A resistance inside the bearing axle heats the rollers, while the thermocouple keeps a constant temperature temperature in order to obtain the best possible sealing.  Fig. 23 - Longitudinal sealing station. ADJUSTMENT The pressure of the rollers is effected by two springs which load the right axle. The pressure is adjustable by operating on the screw M10 [ Fig. 24].  Fig. 24 - Sealing rollers and jaws adjustment.    PROHIBITION! DO NOT CARE WITH MOVING  PROHIBITION!

4.1.8 Sealing jaws  Fig. 25 - Sealing jaws. The sealing jaws [Fig. 25] perform the transversal sealing of the sachets. There are also some teeth placed in correspondence of the lateral edges of the sachets, which serve to create the easy tear notch cut on the sachets. Inside the metal rods there are heaters increase the temperature for the sealing. They are composed of two sections moved by a servomotor. The same considerations that have been made about the sealing rollers apply to the heating system of the jaws. The jaws position and speed are continuously calculated by the motion control to perform the sealing in the right horizontal position in accordance with the bag length set on the display and the position of the mark on the film. The home position of the jaws is the point of contact of the two jaws and corresponds to the start of the sealing. This position is set by a cam, on the back of the jaws, controlled by a sensor [Fig. 26]. All machine phases are related to this point. The phasing of the equipment is set from the operator panel with values that are variable between 0,0 mm to a limit phase according to the bag length (tab: the reference point 0,0 mm corresponds to the position of the jaws in the contact point of the lobes).  Fig. 26 - Jaws homing, cam right position. ADJUSTMENT The pressure of the jaws is effected by two springs which load the right axle. Operate on the screws in order to adjust the pressure. To adjust the home position put machine in emergency. Put a 2 mm thickness between the jaws and adjust the iron cam on the back so the proximity sensor reads the falling edge of cam. The sensor must be placed at the end of the cam hole in reading mode, as shown in Fig. 26.    PROHIBITION! DO NOT CARE WITH MOVING  PROHIBITION!

4.1.9 Pulling rollers  Fig. 28 - Pulling rollers. Pulling rollers are installed after the jaws, which have the function of pulling the sachets and directing them towards the transversal cutting station. The rollers are moved by a motor located inside the machine body. The two pneumatic cylinders installed at the sides of the roller are used to keep the pressure of the rollers constant with respect to the bags to ensure correct towing. 
4.2 Optional 
4.2.1 UV rays group (optional) UV rays lamp [Fig. 29] are installed between the first and the second group of crazy rollers. They are used for hygiene of packaging material. Lamps are switched on and off by means of selector switches on the HMI device. In case of emergency, the machine automatically removes the power to the lamps. With the doors, however, the lamps will be powered but radiation of the rays will be repaired by the plates installed. Operation is also managed through a page on the display. Maintenance or replacement procedures on the specific manual.   Fig. 29  UV ray lamps  WARNING! UV RAYS 
4.2.2 Longitudinal cutting after the sealing (optional)  Fig. 30 - Longitudinal cutting after the sealing. This cutting station can be localized between the rollers and the jaws or after both [Fig. 30], according to the characteristics of the sachets to realize. There are different kinds of blades that perform this operation: a straight-blade, which cuts, or a toothed blade used to mark the "strip". The structure consists of two bands. On the first are placed at a certain distance the disc blades, while on the other are placed some discs that act as counter knife, where the blades lean to make the cut. 
4.2.3 ESD Ionizer (optional)  Fig. 31 - ESD Ionizer. An air ionizer [Fig. 31] is a device that uses high voltage to ionize (electrically charge) air molecules. Negative ions, or anions, are particles with one or more extra electrons, conferring a net negative charge to the particle. Cations are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Most commercial air purifiers are designed to generate negative ions. The type of air ionizer that we use is called ESD ionizer (balanced ion generator) used to neutralize the static charge. This device reduces the accumulation of static electricity in order to preventing that the sachets remain attached on the walls or on the tracks. 
4.2.4 Breath tube (optional)  Fig. 32 - Breath tube. The breath tubes [Fig. 32] are a machine optional. They are installed in order to cool the sealed zone of the sachet and to clean the small parts of polythene that remained attached between the sachets. This system is usually followed by the longitudinal cutting blades. This option is usually used for the machines in line. 
4.2.5 Sachets divider blades (optional)  Fig. 33  Sachets divider blades. This is an optional system. It is composed by some knives that are used to separate the sachets that might remained glued. They are also used to remove the filaments of polythene that may have formed after the first cut lengthwise. This option is typically used for the machines in line. 
4.2.6 Sachet guide rollers (optional) They are located in the last section of the sealing system. They guide the sachets so that they fall correctly on the conveyor belt below.  Fig. 34 - Sachet guide rollers. 4.3  Knife and transversal perforation knife (strip) They are used to cuts the sachets transversally and perform the transversal perforation; the knife is located above the deviator and the transversal perforation knife is placed above the sachets divider rollers. They are composed by a knife (left axle, in movement) and a counter knife (right axle, fixed) and they are moved by a servomotor. The motion control calculate the position of knives to cut or perforate the sachet according to the set value on the operator panel.  ADJUSTMENTS The home position of the knives is exactly on the opposite side of counter knife. This position is adjusted by a cam with its proximity sensor. Put the cam in the position shown in Fig. 35.  Fig. 35 - Transversal knife homing, cam right position. The counter knife pressure is adjusted by acting on the screws [Errore.

4.4 Deviator It is a deviator [Fig. 36] made up of a two pendular motion slide, anchored at its extremities and pneumatically moved. It is called into action by the PLC when sachets are detected that are made while the doser is off. The deviator discharges the bags in the collecting box or on tape waste bags. When the deviator discharge the bags on the tape waste, the bags are transported out of the machine.  Fig. 36 - Deviator. 
4.5 Packaging material reel   Fig. 37 - Packaging material reel: general.  Fig. 38 - Packaging material reel: adjustments. The packaging material is supplied in reels with external diam. of maximum 600mm and maximum width of 1200mm. The reel is found in the back of the packaging machine, seated upon a bearing which automatically permits the centering of its position. The packaging material follows a set passage during which the reel is unrolled without suffering any tears or abrupt variation in speed. In the last section, before passing to the front side of the packaging machine, the film goes through the print group. ADJUSTMENTS In order to work properly the unwinder needs to be properly adjusted. The system includes some sensors: - probe to measure the diameter of the reel - end of reel sensor - alignment sensors Some parameters must be adjusted from operator panel (see details on operator panel instructions). DIAMETER PROBE ADJUST The rotary sensor determines the position of the probe. To adjust the homing point, put the probe directly above the reel holder (without reel) and, after loosening the locking screw, slowly turn the rotor until the blue light of the traffic light does not turn on fixed. Tighten the locking screw. END OF REEL ADJUST The sensor [Fig. 38.2] controls the presence of the blade device [Fig. 38.3]: when the reel is finishing, the beam [Fig. 37.1] goes down to make the blade [Fig. 38.3] touch the sensor [Fig. 38.2].  Adjust the position of the beam [Fig. 38.1] compared to the blade [Fig. 38.3] in order to set a new position of end of reel. END OF REEL PHOTOCELL (OPTIONAL) An optional optical sensor can be placed to detect exactly the end of reel. This functions should be enabled from operator panel (see details on operator panel instructions). In order to use this system, the manufacturer of reel must place a tape (like a junction) 1.5 meters before the end of film. When the end of reel sensor (see previous chapter) detects a low level of film, the end of reel photocell is enabled. At the first junction that will be detected the machine will be stopped. To adjust the settings of the photocell follow the instruction at page 34. REEL CENTERING Adjust the reel centering photocells [Fig. 38.4] support in order to keep the border of the reel in the right position (the dividing knife has to stay exactly in the middle of the reel).

5 CONTROL PANEL      FOREWORD       This section describes all the features and functionality of the operator panel from the physical description of the interface to the functionality of each screen. There is also a description of each command with the distinction between the buttons on which we can make changes and buttons on which we can only read the values from the machine.   
5.1 Description of the control panel The control panel [Fig. 39] is the device that allows the user to interface with the machine controlling and setting machines parameters. We can determine and edit the timing of production, the size and quantity, etc. The panel is placed on the right side of the car, outside the control cabinet. We can divide the panel into two parts:  - The hardware part, placed in the low part of the panel that consists of all the electrical components such as buttons and switches and acts on the main electrical controls of the machine. - The panel PC, a touch screen display that allows to edit and display any type of setting.     
5.1.1 Traffic light  A four colors (green, yellow, red and blue) traffic light [Fig. 40] is located above the control panel. Its provided with a siren with adjustable volume. It represents the different states of the machines:  Blinking green	Ready to start Green 			Running Yellow			End of product  Blue              		End of reel Blinking red		Presence of alarm(s) Red			Emergency  An acoustic signal is emitted at the start and the stop of the machine and when the machine stops because of an alarm.  
5.2 Hardware commands The hardware control panel consists of buttons and switches that manage the security emergency, start / stop, reset, and manual control devices applied to the machine. These commands are placed outside the panel PC because they must be quickly accessible without having to browse through the page of the display. In the following part there is a list of all the hardware command with their own functions:  START This button is used to start the machine and it is usually placed at the beginning of the first row. It is a bright electric green button that can be pressed when the machine is ready to start the production. The button lights up for a moment when pressed by the operator and blinks repeatedly when I interrupt the production until the machine is completely stopped. STOP This button is used to stop the machine and is usually placed under the start button. When the button is pressed the machine doesnt stop immediately but it will stop in a certain moment of the cycle. It is an electric button that doesnt light up and can be pressed only when the machine is in motion. ON/OFF  This selector allows the user to switching on and off of the machine. It is a two-state switch, which lights up when the machine is set on. When the user turn off the machine there is a safety system that shut down the main part of the electronic panel in a safe manner. EMERGENCY This is a special electric button that set the emergency conditions switching off all the movable parts of the machine. It must be used in case of emergency or for maintenance operations which do not need to remove voltage. When the machine is ready to restart it can be disabled by turning the key. RESET This button is used to reset the emergency conditions. After an emergency stop the machine must be reset before it can be restarted. Before pushing this button remember to unlock the emergency stop button and wait until the button light up.  DOSER UP/DOWN (OPTIONAL)  This is a key switch that allows the operator to manually adjust the vertical position of the entire doser structure. STRIP AUTO/MANUAL (OPTIONAL) This selector allows the user to switching the machine mode. It is a two-state switch, which lights up when the machine is set in manual mode. When the machine is set in automatic mode the knife and the strip run as set in the operators panel. When it is set in manual mode the machine performs only strip and the knife remains locked. JAWS DISABLE ON/OFF (OPTIONAL)) This selector allows the operator to enable or disable the jaw rotation. This feature allows you to create tubes of packaging material for the cleaning of the injection tubes. LAMP UV GROUP # (OPTIONAL) These switches allow the operator to turn on or turn off the UV lamps. LIGHT JAWS (OPTIONAL) This selector allows to switch On or Off the light near the jaws. ASPIRATOR (OPTIONAL) This selector allows the user to switch On or Off the related aspirator. 
5.3 Panel PC The panel PC [Fig. 41] enables the operator to interact with the machine in a practical and fast way, setting the desired parameters and displaying the data of the machine. After turning on the machine, with the ON / OFF switch, the panel PC displays its presentation page. Then we can do the log in and start the operations.   Fig. 41 - Panel PC.
