How can we resolve this alarm? ETHERCAT NETWORK COMMUNICATION ALARM;The machine's internal EtherCAT network is not working. Try turning the machine off and on again. If the problem persists, check the EtherCAT network connections by referring to the wiring diagram (ETCAT). Contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com).
How can we resolve this alarm? SYSTEM MAJOR ALARMS (GENERIC) - CHECK DIAGNOSTIC;There is a high level system alarm. Check the diagnostics on the HMI panel. Try power cycling the machine, if the problem persists, contact Boatopack (service@boatpack.com).
How can we resolve this alarm? SYSTEM MAJOR ALARMS (AXES) - CHECK DIAGNOSTIC;There is a high level system alarm. Check the diagnostics on the HMI panel. Try power cycling the machine, if the problem persists, contact Boatopack (service@boatpack.com).
Why machine is not moving in manual mode?;"If the machine does not move in manual mode, check: - presence of electrical power and air pressure in the circuit. - HMI screen for alarms, in particular ""Overspeed alarms""; if present, check that the overspeed sensors related to the axis indicated in the alarm are intact and working, and that the distance between the proximity and the cam is no more than 0.3mm. If there is no alarm, check all the overspeed proximity switches in the same way."
Why machine is not moving after switch on?;First check whether the machine performs the homing procedure or not once the emergency is reset. If so, check the Start button circuit referring to the wiring diagram. Otherwise, check for electrical power and air. If not, check the safety circuit. If not, there may be a problem with the machine's EtherCAT network, check for a specific alarm on the HMI panel or an alarm on the PLC. In this case contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com)
Why machine is not moving after switching from manual mode to automatic mode?;"Try resetting any alarms. Also try forcing a homing procedure (press start and immediately press the emergency button; then reset the alarms, reset the emergency)."
Doser is enabled and in line, but it does not move, why?;Try a homing of the doser, if it does not move check the movement transmission mechanics (refer to the doser manual). If homing is done correctly, check if the film joint system is enabled and if the sensor reads consistently (badly calibrated), in this case calibrate with teach.
The sachets are leaking product, how can I fix it?;First, find out where the sachets are leaking (vertical or transverse seal). Check if the sachets made without product have air leaks. If so, check the cleanliness, integrity and operation of the sealing stations (refer to the maintenance chapter of the manual). If there is no air leak find the correct dosing phase (referring to the doser manual), if the problem is still not solved contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com).
The reel unwinder does not move properly, we often have alarms related to it, what can I do?;Check that the film passage in the internal part of the machine is correct. If present, it may be that the rotary sensor of the reel unwinder is not calibrated, refer to the rotary sensor calibration procedure, if necessary contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com).
When i change some parameter on the panel the machine doesn't react. what can be the problem?;Probably the communication between HMI and PLC is not working. Check that the ethernet cable connecting the two devices to the switch inside the electrical panel are intact and correctly connected. If everything is ok and a reboot does not solve, contact Boatopack (service@boatopack.com).
How do I create a new user on the HMI?;"To create a new user, you must first log in with a level 4 user. Then access ""user manager"" in the log in pop-up, and select ""+User"". Then, fill in the data for the new user."
